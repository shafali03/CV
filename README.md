I'm a full-stack developer who recently graduated from Makers. My background pharmacy, I worked in communities and hospitals pharmacy. I decided to change my profession to become a full-stack developer as healthcare was lacking from these technologies. Speaking to senior staff and suggesting innovative, new ideas, I received positive feedback from my colleagues. One day I like to bring my ideas to life. 

Overall, I am passionate about embarking on a career in the IT industry and would like to pursue my passion as a software engineer. I am continually learning new skills and updating my portfolio. It helps to
demonstrate my enthusiasm and passion for web development, and I am eager to build the foundations for a lifelong career as a software engineer. 

## Skills
<a name="skill-id"></a>

### Attention to details

During my extensive career within the pharmaceutical industry, I have developed a strong attention to detail. For example, as a pharmacy accredited technician, I completed a course at Royal Berkshire Hospital, checking 1000 medicines without errors. Once I completed the course, I was able to conduct the final checks to verify the prescription is dispensed correctly. I believe this is a focal skill that is necessary as a software engineer to help identify errors and provide a solution to fix the bug.


### Team player

While working at the hospital, I worked well as a team and supporting my colleagues whenever they needed help. When working as a team increase our productivity, we were able to accomplish our task sooner
and also reduce mistakes. Whenever I worked in groups, I always give other team members a chance to talk and show respect for what others have to say, so everyone feels comfortable.
