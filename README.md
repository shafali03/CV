I'm Shafique a front end developer based in High Wycombe, and I love creating fun, innovative, accessible and fast website. 
In the past, I've worked in the pharmaceutical industry. While working in healthcare, I discovered endless opportunities that can be used with programming to transform and improve patients lives after discovery AI technology in hospitals. I was obsessed with coding when I created my first website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript since then I've fallen in love with coding and never looked back. I'm an enthusiastic front end developer worked as a freelancer before joining Makers. A highly motivated person who has an immense will to learn I'm looking for challenging projects working as front end developer.

## Skills

### Attention to details

During my extensive career within the pharmaceutical industry, I have developed a strong attention to detail. For example, as a pharmacy accredited technician, I completed a course at Royal Berkshire Hospital, checking 1000 medicines without errors. Once I completed the course, I was able to conduct the final checks to verify the prescription is dispensed correctly. I believe this is a focal skill that is necessary as a software engineer to help identify errors and provide a solution to fix the bug.


### Team player


While working at Makers, I've worked with people from all diversity of backgrounds for our team projects. I love working in teams showing my creativity and brainstorming ideas as a group. Putting my trust in my cohort allows ideas to emerge because it provides a feeling of safety. In our group projects communication was our key for creating solutions to our projects
