I'm a full-stack developer who recently graduated from Makers. My background pharmacy, I worked in communities and hospitals pharmacy. I decided to change my profession to become a full-stack developer. I was able to identify what technology the NHS was lacking. Speaking to senior staff and suggesting innovative, new ideas, I received positive feedback from my colleagues. One day I like to bring my ideas to life. 

Overall, I am passionate about embarking on a career in the IT industry and would like to pursue my passion as a software engineer. I am continually learning new skills and updating my portfolio. It helps to
demonstrate my enthusiasm and passion for web development, and I am eager to build the foundations for a lifelong career as a software engineer.

## Skills

### Attention to details

During my extensive career within the pharmaceutical industry, I have developed a strong attention to detail. For example, as a pharmacy accredited technician, I completed a course at Royal Berkshire Hospital, checking 1000 medicines without errors. Once I completed the course, I was able to conduct the final checks to verify the prescription is dispensed correctly. I believe this is a focal skill that is necessary as a software engineer to help identify errors and provide a solution to fix the bug.


### Team player

While working at the hospital, I worked well in teams and supporting my colleagues whenever they needed help. Working in teams increased our productivity. We can accomplish our task sooner than later and reduce mistakes. Working in teams allow me to share new ideas and create more effective solutions.
